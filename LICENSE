e-CODUCT web appplication
****************************

This application uses a two-stage Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to find the most profitable 24-hour plan for powering an electrically-powered energy-intensive reactor, as part of a plant that contains a solar PV array, wind turbines, and a battery energy storage system (BESS). Electricity can also be bought and sold on the day-ahead and intraday markets.

This model takes into account that the optimal production plan relies on modelling the renewable energy generation and electricity prices for the next day. As these values are not known with certainty, this model creates multiple possible scenarios based on an input forecast, and calculates the production plan that will, on average, generate the most profit over all scenarios.

1. ABSTRACT
-----------

A 2-stage stochastic MILP model was developed for the e-CODUCT project ( https://e-coduct.eu/ ) and used to make a web application that can be easily utilized by industrial users. The app was developed based on the principles that industrial adoption is dependent on the app's ease-of-use, interpretability, and flexibility. The resulting product is a clear, configurable application that outputs data in easy to use and easy to understand formats.


2. SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES

8. CONTACTING THE AUTHOR(s)
---------------------------

We would very much appreciate hearing from you if you use e-coduct web app and find problems,
or if you can think of ways it could be improved - and even (or is that
'especially'?) if you just think it's great. Even if the facility you would
like to see appears to be of interest only to you, tell us about it - you'd be
surprised how many ideas in that class have a much wider appeal.

See above for further contact information.

We read and consider all mail we receive, even though we may not have time
to reply
